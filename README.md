# MicroTools

This plugin is designed to provide a set of useful utility tools for VCV Rack.

### Push Button
A button that you can push! Sends bipolar control voltages (-5V to +5V, +1V by default) based on the control knobs. Use this to trigger gates or send temporary signals without the need for a clock or LFO!

### Recorder
Hook any input signal to this module and click the switch to start recording! Click again to stop. This module outputs wav files.
